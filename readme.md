# Dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

Also included is an interactive bootstrap script for symlinking dotfiles to 
your home directory.

## Install

As this repo contains my dotfile preferences, you'll probably want to fork 
this repo, and replace my dotfiles with your own.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/brentertz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
